## 1. Conceptual Deconstruction-based News INTent Understanding Framework (NINT)

Intent refers to a cognitive state that emerges from rational planning, grounded in the agent's desires and beliefs. News creation intent refers to the purpose or intention behind the creation of a news article. 

We present the first **Conceptual Deconstruction-based News INTent Understanding framework (NINT)**, deconstructing news intent from perspectives of rational action and outcomes. 

NINT deconstructs the concept of news intent into beliefs, desires, and plans using interdisciplinary theories. It further situates these elements within the specific context of news to investigate the concrete manifestations of news intent.

**To the best of our knowledge, this is the first news creation intent dataset through a deconstruction approach.**


## 2. Dataset Construction

The overall process of building the NewsInt dataset is shown below:

<div align= center>
<img src="figs/fig3.png" width="500px" >
</div>

We collect raw data from 511 news domains, resulting in 12,959 news articles with an average of 5.45 discussion posts from Reddit for each news article. The obtained news articles show diverse distribution on contemporary topics (such as general politics or the US presidential race, the COVID-19 pandemic, women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs rights, climate change, vaccines, abortion, gun control, 5G, etc.).
